### Typing Test

The typing test measures your typing speed and accuracy by having you type a series of words within a time limit. Your performance is measured in WPM (Words Per Minute) and accuracy percentage.

### Difficulty Levels

There are three difficulty levels:
- **Easy**: Common short words
- **Intermediate**: Moderate length words
- **Hard**: Longer, more complex words

Choose the level that matches your typing proficiency.

### Real-time Feedback

During the test, you receive real-time feedback on your typing speed, accuracy, and mistakes. This helps you identify areas for improvement and track your progress over time.

### Progress Tracking

After completing the test, you can view detailed performance metrics, including WPM, accuracy percentage, number of mistakes, and time taken. This allows you to monitor your improvement and set goals for future practice.
